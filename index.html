      String Encryption </h3>
    <h4>By Carlos Enrique Hernandez Ibarra 07 August 2016 Guadalajara Jalisco.</h4>

<p>[Sp]La encriptacion de cadenas en Qt/C++ se realiza mediante un cambio de valores de cada elemento y el cambio
de posiciones de los elementos en el arreglo</p>

<p>
  [En] The String Encryptation in Qt/C++ is performance by a change in the value of each element in a array and the change
  between the position of element in the same array.
</p>

<p>[Sp] Por ejemplo, tenemos el String "Hola Mundo", mediante una clave podremos a√±adir/disminuir a la "H" en su valor hexadecimal
  la clave seleccionada; a esto se le llamada "shift". Tambien podemos cambiar el orden mediante una funcion "permute" que pueda
  realizar algo similar a esto: "MHuonldoo "</p>
  
<p>
  [En] For example, we have the string "Hola Mundo", through a key we are allowed to add/substract to the Hexadecimal value of
  "H" character; this is called "shift". As well we can change the order by a "permute" function that may performe something similar
  that this: "MHuonldoo"

<script src="https://gist.github.com/CharlieHdzMx/0d610436cd0ffed32d8fc37ebfebd5c8.js"></script>

<p>[Sp] Ademas de una clave numerica, se necesita una secuencia de operaciones que vuelven mas confiable la encriptacion. 
 Por ejemplo, teniendo un arreglo de "SPSPP" significa que se realizara un shift,permute,shift,permute y permute en ese orden.
 Sinceramente en su momento este codigo me parecio bastante dificil, con algunas combinaciones de claves y secuencias de encriptamiento
 la aplicacion falla :(, si deseas contribuir da <a href="https://github.com/WiwipetDevelopment/wiwipetdevelopment.github.io/tree/master/Chapter-5-Functions/Crypto">click here</a>.</p>
 
 <p>[En] In addition to a numerical key, its necessary a operation sequence that turn the encryption more trustworthy.
 For example, having a array of "SPSPP", it means that makes a shit,permute,shift,permute y permute in that order.
 Sincerely, in it moment, this code seemed to me pretty difficult. In fact with some keys combinations and encryption sequences,
 the application fail< :(, if you wanna to contribute <a href="https://github.com/WiwipetDevelopment/wiwipetdevelopment.github.io/tree/master/Chapter-5-Functions/Crypto">click here</a>.</p>

      C++ Operator Overloading</h3>
    <h4>By Carlos Enrique Hernandez Ibarra 05 August 2016 Guadalajara Jalisco.</h4>
      
    <div align=justify> 
<p>Develop a Fraction class with the methods for calculating addition,substration,multiplication and division.
Also add overloaded operators for the same arithmetic operations and various kinds of comparison In each case the parameter
should be a const Fraction&. Write client code to test your new operators.</p>

<p>
  To be useful, a Fraction object should be able to interact with other kinds
of numbers. Expand the definition of Fraction so that the operators in your
solution to Problem 1 also work for int and double. It should be clear, for
example, how to get frac + num to be correctly evaluated. How would you
handle the expression num + frac, where frac is a fraction and num is an int?
Write client code to test your new functions.
</p>

<p>
  Add arithmetic and comparison operators to the class Complex. Write client
code to test your expanded class. //I didn't complete this part, Would you like to colaborate?
</p>

<p>
  We focused to the methods relevant of the theme (Overloading Operators) So the principal functions declaration are below:
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/CharlieHdzMx/6518847cdf9ce2da17c1995d82aca89a.js"></script>

<p>
  There are 2 differents functions: 1) Binary non member functions (functions with the "friend" keyword= 
  2) Binary member function using a instance to perform algorithms with non Fraction parameters.
  The implementation of these functions differ each other as show in the next code:
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/CharlieHdzMx/ad15190715604f52b9840eca56c75156.js"></script>

<p>
  A few functions were used to achieve better code, called 2 simplify() functions, a set() function, 3 overloaded
  function and member access function (for encapsulation purpose):

<p>
  Finally there are some quick tips about this theme from our friends Alan Ezust and Paul Ezust:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The keyword operator is used in C++ to define a new meaning for an operator symbol,such as +, -, =, *, and &.</li>

<li>Overloaded operators provide a more compact syntax for calling functions, leading to more readable code (assuming 
the operators are used in ways that are commonly understood).</li>

<li>it is possible to overload operators as member functions, or as global functions. The primary difference that you notice first 
is how they can be called. In particular, a member function operator requires an object as the left operand. A global 
function, in contrast,permits the same kinds of type conversions for either operand.</li>

<li>Here is a way to remember which operators can be overloaded.
If the symbol has a dot (.) in it anywhere, overloading is probably not allowed.</li>

<li>Overloading the comma operator is permitted but not recommended until you are a C++ expert.</li>

<li>It is possible to define a new meaning for a built-in operator symbol so that it can be used with operands 
of different types. But it is not possible to change the associativity or the precedence of a built-in operator symbol.</li>
</ol>

<h4>By Carlos Enrique Hernandez Ibarra 01 August 2016 Guadalajara Jalisco.</h4>

<div align=justify> 
<p>[En] The DNA Analysis to the Thermo Fisher Challenge was developed with <b>Qt/C++ </b> 
Getting a population of patients,the application should determine the percentage of population that is infected.
The program composed by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download of DNA patients files (.dna format) from URL's<./li>
  <li>Analysis each DNA patients file sequence in form of a string composed of a sequence of characters A,C,G and T.</li>
  <li>Calculate if the patient is infected by calculationg the number of ocurrences of all characters. If the number of
       ocurrences of T is greater than all the other characters, the patient is infected; if not, the patient isn't infected</li>
  <li> Determine the rounded percentage of infected population <i>%Infected= # of Infected/Total Patients</i></li>
</ol>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/CharlieHdzMx/a000cb3b18e05d7bb4c47e145c5d8867.js"></script>
<p>
  So the first step was to download the DNA patient files. Using the <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qnetworkaccessmanager.html">
    QNetworkAccessManager</a> as a object in a class called DownloadManager that inherits from QObject. We set a list of
    QNetworkReply to determine when there are not more files to download and stop the application. Also we used another
    list to contain the names of the DNA files to futher analysis.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/CharlieHdzMx/895d322c0e41970cd8c6e2b593a434b2.js"></script>
<p>
  So, in the main loop, we are going to put a DownloadManager object. The constructor of DownloadManager trigger a connection 
  between a QNetworkAccessManager and the DownloadManager slot downloadFinished(). This function perform the analysis of DNA patient
  in the last setted DNA file<i>Note: If you aren't familiarized with this behaviour
  of Sinals and Slots in Qt, we recommend read <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/signalsandslots.html">this tutorial</a></i>
</p>

<p>
  Before annoucing the downloadFinished() method. We are going to talk about the implementation of execute that is the trigger
  to begin the download of DNA files. It achieve a bifurcation when the command is without parameters. The other way call
  the QNetworkAccessManager hosting of the download request from the url's
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/CharlieHdzMx/04f64ac0e45e3f703181f1a221196cda.js"></script>

<p>
  Finally, the downloadFinished() method. Its general purpose is to analysis all the download files counting the amount of 
  ocurrences of the characters. Son we process each file, count all the ocurrences and calculate the percentage of infected 
  people. We used the QFile class to achieve the file processing to save the string to a QByteArray (that contains char characters)
  Also we used the Patient class to hold the amount of characters A,C,G and T. And later we calculate and print the results
  to the terminal.<code> ./download 1.dna 2.dna 3.dna</code>
