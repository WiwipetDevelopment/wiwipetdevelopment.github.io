<p>[En] The DNA Analysis to the Thermo Fisher Challenge was developed with <b>Qt/C++ by Carlos E. Hernandez.</b> 
Getting a population of patients,the application should determine the percentage of  the population that is infected.
The program composed by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download of DNA patients files (.dna format) from URL's</li>
  <li>Analysis each DNA patients file sequense in form of a string composed of a sequence of characters A,C,G and T.</li>
  <li>Calculate if the patient is infected by calculationg the number of ocurrences of all characters. If the number of
       ocurrences of T is greater than all the other characters, the patient is infected; if not, the patient isn't infected</li>
  <li> Determine the rounded percentage of infected population</li>
</ol>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/CharlieHdzMx/a000cb3b18e05d7bb4c47e145c5d8867.js"></script>
<p>
  So the first step was to download the DNA patient files. Using the <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qnetworkaccessmanager.html">
    QNetworkAccessManager</a> as a object in a class called DownloadManager that inherits from QObject. We set a list of
    QNetworkReply to determine whenever there is not more download files to download and stop the application; and we used another
    list to contain the names of the DNA files to futher analysis.

<p>
  So, in the main loop, we are going to put a DownloadManager object. The constructor of DownloadManager trigger a connection 
  between a QNetworkAccessManager and the DownloadManager slot downloadFinished(). This function perform the analysis of DNA patient
  in the last setted DNA file<i>Note: If you aren't familiarized with this behaviour
  of Sinals and Slots in Qt, we recommend read <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/signalsandslots.html">this tutorial</a></i>
</p>

<p>
  Before annoucing the downloadFinished() method. We are going to talk about the implementation of execute that is the trigger
  to begin the download of DNA files. It achieve a bifurcation when the command is without parameters. The other way call
  the QNetworkAccessManager hosting of the download request from the url's
